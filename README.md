Overview
The Ocultum 4STM4 is a concept for a rugged handheld communication device, designed with a cyberpunk military aesthetic yet engineered for real-world practicality.
Our intention is to create a tool that merges multiple wireless standards into one compact, durable, and user-focused platform for enthusiasts, field engineers, and tactical operators.

Design Philosophy

Minimal snag points – all controls are recessed or low-profile.

Reliability first – tactile hardware switches, screw-fastened chassis.

Modular communication – cellular, LoRa, Wi-Fi, and traditional radio.

Cyberpunk military style – a device that feels at home in both the field and the future.
